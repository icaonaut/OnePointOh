Starting point to use this hub - people who are lost can look at this stuff first

Innovation 4 Aviation is a place where we post our feeble attempts at taking one of the most modern forms of transport back to (and alas sometime over) the cutting edge of development.  Since innovation starts at home, and the home of the initial controbutors is in regulation, some of our initial stuff may be doomed to be as exciting as bureaucracy can be.  Out of that, however, we hope we can spur excitement amonsgt the aviaiton and regulatory communitties to find the best of innovation and cut-and-paste it into our common domains (that and perhaps find a way to care more about spelling).  At times we hope to have done something - even if we will never knwo how and why - that others may cut-and-paste out of our domain into whatever they do.

All the stuff posted here is open and free. not becuase we are generous but becuase its such a pain to find a way to pay for a private channel - did i mention we were working in a bureaucracy?.  Please let us know, if you want to re-publish something here... not becuase we are worried about intelectual propoerty, but beucase a) you may be copying somehting that we copied; b) context is very important to ensure that replication does not inadvertantly generate fake news; and c) when we tell our managers that people like out stuff they give us a look that goes away only  when we can provide names... and quite frankly thanks the creativity of the parents of the baby boomers (and subsequent generations) it is really difficult to come up with plausablie fake names (beucase there are so many real names that sound made up).

As you have hopefully figured out these pages are meant to "share and enjoy" - so please check in every so often to be be bored to bits.
